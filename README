python-codelib: Python interface to CodeLib algorithms
======================================================

[CodeLib] is collection of algorithms for applications in the area of
Scientific Computing developed by the Konrad-Zuse-Zentrum f√ºr
Informationstechnik [ZIB].

The ZIB-CodeLib software is not freely distributable and is not included in
this package. Sources for individual package may be downloaded from the
[CodeLib] website.

Supported algorithms
--------------------

Currently, the Python interface includes some algorithms for Nonlinear
systems of equations and least squares, accessible through the `nonlin`
module in the `codelib` package.
-   [NLEQ1]: Newton-method, full or bandmode Jacobian, without rank-strategy
-   [NLEQ1S]: Newton-method, sparse Jacobian, without rank-strategy, with
    linear solver UMFPACK


Installation
------------

The installation requires LAPACK, BLAS, UMFPACK and AMD development
libraries as well as a Fortran and C compiler.

First, one has to obtain the sources of the [CodeLib] library of supported
packages mentioned above.
* From [NLEQ1], extract the files `nleq1.f`, `wnorm.f`, `zibconst.f`,
  `zibmon.f` and `zibsec.f` and put them in the `codelib/nleq1` directory.
* From [NLEQ1S], extract the files `nleq1s.f`, `wnorm.f`, `zibconst.f`,
  `zibmon.f` and `zibsec.f` as well as either `umfpack_interface.c` or
  `y12m_interface.f` and `linalg_nleq1s.f` and put them in the
  `codelib/nleq1s` directory.

Then, to run the installation, one uses e.g. `python setup.py install
--user`.

Usage
-----

Currently, `codelib` ships one module `nonlin` which contains a function
`root` from which either [NLEQ1] or [NLEQ1S] algorithms can be called.
